# Password Generator Starter Code

## In this project, I was to design Javascript code to let me create a randomly generated password at the click of a button. The purpose of this application
was to let a user create a secure password for their needs. I learned and applied basic functions in Javascript to familiarize myself with the how to use the
code. I learned the process of writing better code and to use computational thinking. I hope to gain a fuller understanding of the different processes I find 
in Javascript and to be able to write concise code.
